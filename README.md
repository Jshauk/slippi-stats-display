# slippi-stats-display
Uses the Melee Stream Tool and the Project Slippi  slippi-set-stats to generate a BTS-like stats screen

Download slippi-set-stats from here https://github.com/project-slippi/slippi-set-stats/releases/tag/v1.0.0
Download the Melee Stream Tool here https://github.com/Readek/Melee-Stream-Tool/releases/tag/v1

Put the slippi stats.html file, scripts folder, and the SSS exe into the root folder of the Melee Stream Tool. That's it.
Use the Melee Stream Tool like you normally would first and hit update.
To generate the data, drop the match replay .slp files into the root of the Melee Stream Tool and run the SSS exe. 

This will not display properly in a browser.

Add the html file into an obs scene set to 1920x1080 and add whatever background and title you want.

This is a work in progress, but it's useable enough for streams and I'm bad at coding so this is it for now.
